# About

World Wide Weeb was created as a final project for my Software Engineering class in my second year of university. 

This is meant to be a more family-friendly browser for all things anime and manga, akin to https://myanimelist.net/. This program uses Javascript AJAX to retrieve data from our chosen [API](https://api.jikan.moe/v3). The website first consists of a home page which allows users to select either an anime or manga menu.

Within the anime menu, the user is met with a page consisting of current trending animes, their conver photo, and some basic information about the anime. The user can click on a specified link to be redirected to the https://myanimelist.net/ link corresponding to the chosen title. The user can also search for anime or filter by category. All NSFW categories are automatically removed from the search results.

Within the manga menu, the user can search for manga and is able to view basic information, a cover photo, and a link to the https://myanimelist.net/ link corresponding to the chosen title.

A dark mode is available by clicking the "Toggle Lights" button located at the top right corner of the page. This enables a dark mode version of the site on every page except the home page, which is by default a dark themed page. There is also access to the home menu, the anime menu, and the manga menu within the page header. A logo redirecting to the home page can also be found in the top left corner (logo made by yours truly).
